Now, you can click on screen sharing on the electron and select the window you want to share.

#### Add desktop version and native browser rendering

Supports opening web pages that cannot be opened due to restrictions in the web version


For example, the following is a web page that cannot be nested due to website policies and will not be embedded due to web security restrictions.

But you can turn on native rendering of web pages and use built-in native browser rendering instead of embedding web pages.

In this way, you can break through the security restrictions of the other party's website and embed it into any page freely, just like using a browser
